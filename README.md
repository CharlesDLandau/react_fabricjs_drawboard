# react_fabricjs_drawboard
Simplistic react component with draw tools based on FabricJS. Variation on https://github.com/CharlesDLandau/react_fabricjs_tictactoe

### TODO:

Improve README, docs. Improve UI. Establish CONTRIBUTING.md, CI, dockerize, publish to NPM, and so much more. I hope I get to some of that.
